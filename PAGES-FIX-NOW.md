# Do this so https://biggleem.github.io/nc-clicker-game-v1/ works

The code is already on GitHub. You only need to **turn on GitHub Pages** (one-time setup).

---

## Step 1: Open Pages settings

1. Go to: **https://github.com/biggleem/nc-clicker-game-v1**
2. Click **Settings** (top tab bar of the repo).
3. In the **left sidebar**, under **"Code and automation"**, click **Pages**.

---

## Step 2: Set the publishing source

Under **"Build and deployment"**:

1. **Source:** click the dropdown and choose **"Deploy from a branch"**.
2. **Branch:** click the dropdown and choose **main**, then **/ (root)**.
3. Click **Save**.

## Step 3: Check repo visibility

- If the repo is **Private**, GitHub Pages will **not** work on a free account.
- Go to **Settings → General**.
- Scroll to **"Danger zone"**.
- If you see **"Change repository visibility"** and it says **Private**, click it and change to **Public**.

---

## Step 4: Wait and open the site

- Wait **2–5 minutes**.
- Open: **https://biggleem.github.io/nc-clicker-game-v1/**
- If you see the green **"Your site is live at …"** at the top of the **Settings → Pages** page, the site is deployed. Use that URL.

---

## If it still says "There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"

- Confirm you clicked **Save** in the Pages section.
- Confirm **Branch** is **main** and **Folder** is **/ (root)**.
- Confirm the repo is **Public** (Settings → General).
- Try in an **incognito/private** window: **https://biggleem.github.io/nc-clicker-game-v1/**
